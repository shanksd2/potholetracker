The font should be a little joke on the heaps of traffic signs we have her in Germany.
The first try was disappointing to me. The font was difficult to read and didn´t look 
like I imagined. So I did a second Version, in which all traffic signs got the same 
size. The capital letters were completely changed to roads.

My hint:
Type the word normally and if it has too many traffic signs, change a traffic sign 
(=lower cap) into road (= upper cap).

I also updated the first Version. The upper caps are now roads, too.

I hope you like the font nevertheless. Juat try a little bit!
